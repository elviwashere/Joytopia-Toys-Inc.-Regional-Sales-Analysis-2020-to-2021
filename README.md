## Project Background
Joytopia Toys Inc. is a toy retailer established in 2020, specializing in best-selling products such as Lego bricks, action figures, and Nerf guns, with operations in three major regions: New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. As a newly hired Business Intelligence Consultant, I was tasked with supporting the company’s goals to increase revenue. I developed an interactive dashboard to help regional sales managers monitor monthly performance and answer key business questions such as how revenue is trending, which products are performing best or worst, and how dependent overall sales are on a small group of top-performing products.

Designed to deliver **surface-level insights**, the dashboard provides a high-level overview of sales trends and product performance. By centralizing performance metrics and automating monthly reporting, the dashboard reduced manual reporting time from **6–8 hours to under 1 hour per month**, saving each regional manager valuable time and increasing operational efficiency by an estimated **10–15%**.

## Data Structure Overview
This dataset contains **6,225 transaction** records from Joytopia Toys Inc. spanning the years 2020 and 2021. It includes **10 attributes**: order ID, date, store ID, region ID, store type ID, product name, product category, units sold, revenue, and profit.

## Executive Summary

</div>

In November, Joytopia’s Chicago region achieved $144,000 in revenue—a 37% increase from October—reflecting strong pre-holiday demand. Toys remained the top-selling category, while the Games category grew the fastest at 50.6%. Five key products, led by Lego Bricks, contributed nearly 39% of total revenue, highlighting the need to maintain stock availability. Conversely, products like Classic Dominoes, Foam Disk Launcher, and Jenga saw notable revenue declines, indicating a need for discounting or repositioning. With sales momentum returning, Joytopia is well-positioned to finish Q4 strong through targeted promotions and optimized product strategy.

## Insights Deep-Dive

### Total Monthly Revenue

</div>

In November 2021, Joytopia’s Chicago region generated **$144,607** in total revenue. This reflects a 3**7.5% increase compared to October**, signaling strong short-term momentum likely driven by pre-holiday demand. However, revenue was **1.0% lower than November 2020**, indicating that the region hasn’t fully recovered to its prior-year peak. This gap suggests an opportunity to review last year’s winning strategies whether in pricing, promotion, or inventory to understand what might be missing this year.

### Trend Outlook

</div>

Overall, **2021 outperformed 2020**, with the exception of a notable spike in April 2020. The trendline comparison reveals that while sales in mid-2021 lagged behind the previous year, the strong rebound in **November indicates a potential recovery**. If this upward momentum continues, December is well-positioned to exceed last year’s performance. To fully capitalize on Q4 opportunities, it's essential to deploy targeted campaigns and secure inventory for high-performing SKUs.

### Product Category Breakdown

</div>

In November 2021, **_Toys_** remained the **top-performing category** with $49,546 in revenue and a strong 39.1% MoM growth, reinforcing its role as the backbone of monthly sales. While **_Games_** contributed less overall ($16,801), it delivered the _**fastest growth**_ at +50.6%, pointing to a surge in consumer interest—potentially driven by trending items like Rubik’s Cube. This growth trajectory suggests an opportunity to capitalize through deeper stock, seasonal bundling, or in-store promotions. In contrast, **_Electronics and Sports & Outdoors_** posted **modest revenues with slower MoM growth**, signaling steady but less dynamic segments. To drive incremental gains, these lower-growth categories may benefit from tighter assortment management or repositioning to avoid shelf space inefficiency.

### Best and Under Performing Products

</div>

In November 2021, **Lego Bricks** and **Magic Sand** saw the **biggest revenue increases**, up by $3,999 and $2,463 compared to October. These products continue to be strong performers and should be prioritized in promotions, bundled offers, and holiday campaigns. **Action Figures** and **Rubik’s Cube** also showed **solid growth**, making them good options for upselling or giving more shelf space to drive additional sales.

Meanwhile, **Classic Dominoes** (-$450), **Foam Disk Launcher** (-$400), and **Jenga** (-$220) experienced a **drop in revenue**. This could mean customer interest is falling or that the products aren’t getting enough attention in-store. It’s worth reviewing whether these items should be discounted, bundled with better-performing products, or even removed from the main display to make room for faster-selling ones.

### Top Product Concentration

</div>

An important finding this month is that **38.99% of total revenue came from just five products**, with **Lego Bricks** leading at $18,396, followed by Magic Sand, Nerf Gun, Dino Egg, and Rubik’s Cube. While these top products drive volume, this level of concentration also highlights **risk**: if even one of them goes out of stock, overall revenue could take a hit. Ensuring consistent availability of these key items is critical going into the holiday season.

## Recommendations
These are the Strategic Actions for December:
- **Ensure stock availability for top 5 products** – These products contributed nearly 39% of November’s revenue and are critical to Q4 success.
- **Promote the Games category** – Despite lower revenue, it showed the highest MoM growth (+50.6%), signaling rising demand.
- **Bundle best-sellers** – Strong performers like Action Figures and Rubik’s Cube can drive larger basket sizes when sold together.
- **Review underperforming items** – Products with revenue declines (e.g., Dominoes, Jenga) may need discounting or repositioning.
- **Run targeted holiday campaigns** – November's recovery trend suggests a strong finish is possible with focused seasonal marketing.
